## A Controlled Proof-of-Concept: Remote Input Simulation & Data Collection. 
This repository documents a controlled proof-of-concept created to demonstrate how peripheral input devices can be used to simulate legitimate user actions on a Windows host within an explicitly authorized test environment. The project intentionally operates only under written, pre-authorized engagements and within isolated networks and was not used for any nefarious uses. It demonstrates detection opportunities, defensive countermeasures so that defenders, can evaluate risk.
